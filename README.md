# CMPSC 263 Project

By Kali Hale and Aaron Jimenez

## Overview

Java, C++, and Python are three of the five most popular programming languages [in use today](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022). Using their most common runtime implementations, these languages function very differently during runtime - for example, Java and Python runtimes use garbage-collection, while the most popular C++ compilers require the programmer to free memory manually. However, what may be well-suited for one situation may be remarkably ill-suited for another. In order to choose the best language and runtime implementation for a project, we must first know what the limitations are for each. While we may understand technically what these differences should mean for the programmer, it is useful to gain a practical understanding of these differences. To get a baseline understanding of the practical differences between the languages, we have implemented several well-known sorting algorithms in Java, C++, and Python and compared real-time runtimes and memory usage for each when using the same hardware.
